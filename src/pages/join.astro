============================================================================
MIGRATION SUMMARY - join.astro (CORRECTED VERSION)
============================================================================

✅ WHAT CHANGED (Minimal, preserving design):
1. Imports:
   - Added: Card, LinkButton components
   - Added: withBase, buildSEO, EXTERNAL_LINKS utilities
   - Removed: Duplicate withBase function, manual SEO construction

2. Replaced ONLY wrappers, kept ALL internal structure:
   - <section class="surface-panel"> → <Card as="section">
   - Hard-coded formURL → EXTERNAL_LINKS.formURL
   - <a class="button"> → <LinkButton> (only the final CTA button)

✅ WHAT DIDN'T CHANGE (Preserved design):
- ALL section headers kept as-is (h2 elements)
- ALL grid layouts untouched
- ALL card internals preserved (.acknowledgement-card, .start-card, etc.)
- ALL existing CSS classes maintained
- Visual appearance should be IDENTICAL

✅ KEY LESSON:
- Card component is just a wrapper - it doesn't change internal content
- The .acknowledgement-card, .start-card classes handle the actual styling
- We replaced the outer .surface-panel wrapper, not the inner cards
- This preserves your exact visual design
