            ArcUp unites ethics, technology, and experimentation to make plasma research

        </p>
        <p>  <!-- can we keep this colouyr white -->
            By sharing methods and results openly, the framework builds
            <em>transparency, trust,</em> and collaboration between people, communities, and researchers.

        <h3>Purpose: Regeneration as Practice</h3>
        <p><!-- can we get this colour muted -->
            ArcUp turns research into a <strong>shared act of regeneration</strong> — open,
            ethical, and collaborative.
        </p>
        <p> <!-- can we keep this colouyr white -->
            Each experiment explores how plasma can support life systems and how
            <em>open science</em> can model a more regenerative relationship with Earth.
