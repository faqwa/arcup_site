          <h3>Curiosity</h3>
          <p>
            I began reading plasma research papers from around the world, 
            studying how others explored plasma–water interactions.

          <h3>Learning the Basics</h3>
          <p>
            The papers were dense, so I turned to videos and tutorials. 
            Watching others build home reactors helped me understand the core physics and electronics.

          <h3>Building a Reactor</h3>
          <p>
            After days of trial and error, I created stable plasma arcs using a flyback transformer and a driver circuit.

          <h3>Experimenting</h3>
          <p>
            I tested different electrodes and water types.  
            Accidentally formed salt crystals, and discovered plasma-treated water improved seed germination.

          <h3>Discovering Potential</h3>
          <p>
            Plasma could alter biological processes.  
            I wondered how to design better systems for efficiency and ecological impact.

          <p>
            What if I shared my progress publicly?  
            Would others join in, help improve it, or replicate it?  
            That question became the seed of ArcUp.

          Watching seeds respond to plasma was the beginning of ArcUp.

        align="center"
    />

    <p>
        Looking back across centuries, I saw a cycle of conflict, power, profit, and harm
        repeating itself in the name of “progress.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The current scientific paradigm isn’t so different. A pattern of extraction dressed up as progress:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We rely on funding cycles that gate curiosity.</li>
        <li>Science becomes a strategy for competition.</li>
        <li>Profit replaces purpose.</li>
        <li>Knowledge is gated or delayed for the market.</li>
        <li>Meaning is filtered through authority.</li>
        <li>Scale replaces care.</li>
        <li>And often, we recognise the harm only once it’s too late.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        ArcUp was born from a refusal of that pattern.  
        Let’s do things differently.  
        Let’s not repeat the past—because the results will be the same.

        align="center"
      />

      <p>
        My early plasma experiments were only the beginning.  
        ArcUp grew into a framework — a set of methods, values, and open tools for regenerative plasma research.  
        A way to connect, collaborate, and build knowledge that serves life, not profit.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s science repractised:  
        a reorientation toward transperncy and openness,  
        a recommitment to curiosity and care,  
        toward progress that heals rather than harms.  
        Can innovation once again serve the planet, its communities and our future?

        ArcUp began as one person’s experiment.  
        My hope is that it grows into a collective practice —  
        a shared opportunity to rethink what progress means and what kind of world we want to build.
