          <p>arc^ is guided by <strong>re:earth</strong> — a regenerative technology framework that asks "what world does this create?" before building anything.</p>
          <p>Re:earth includes the RE:TECH design approach and the ethical commitments that shape how we work. This philosophical foundation will soon live on its own site.</p>
          <p class="callout-note">For now, understand that arc^ research is grounded in: openness, ecological interdependence, future-consciousness, harm prevention, and planetary restoration.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>1. Engineering Transparency.</strong>
          Every project begins at the technological layer.  
          We design and document plasma systems so they can be built, tested, and improved anywhere.
          All schematics, safety notes, and operating parameters are shared openly to enable reproducibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. Chemical and Environmental Traceability.</strong>
          Experiments are logged in detail — from discharge conditions to reactive species analysis —
          ensuring that each result can be verified and compared across labs and field sites.
          This builds a shared dataset for understanding plasma–water chemistry in real environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Biological Safety and Benefit.</strong>
          When our work touches living systems, we apply rigorous testing at multiple levels:
          microbial assays, plant trials, and molecular analyses.  
          These studies help define safe exposure limits and identify beneficial thresholds.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>4. Ecological Accountability.</strong>
          The final step is systems thinking — assessing how plasma interventions affect larger
          ecological networks.  
          We monitor nutrient flows, biodiversity, and recovery rates to ensure that local solutions
          contribute to long-term resilience rather than displacement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, these four layers form a cycle of open research:
          <em>design → measure → validate → restore.</em>
          The process is collaborative, iterative, and accountable to the public good.
