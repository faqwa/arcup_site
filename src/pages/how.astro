          <p>arc^ is guided by <strong>re:earth</strong> — a regenerative technology framework that asks "what world does this create?" before building anything.</p>
          <p>Re:earth includes the RE:TECH design approach and the ethical commitments that shape how we work. This philosophical foundation will soon live on its own site.</p>
          <p class="callout-note">For now, understand that arc^ research is grounded in: openness, ecological interdependence, future-consciousness, harm prevention, and planetary restoration.</p>

            <h3>Start Open, Stay Open</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Document from day zero. Every hypothesis, design choice, and experiment goes public from the beginning. No "big reveal" launches — just incremental, transparent progress.</p>

            <h3>Safety Before Innovation</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Every project starts with risk assessment. We identify potential harms — ecological, social, physical — and design safeguards before we build. If we can't do it safely, we don't do it.</p>
        </Card>

            <h3>Share Everything</h3>
          </div>
          <p>All designs, data, and documentation are released under open licenses. No paywalls. No patents. No proprietary lockdowns. Knowledge belongs in the commons.</p>

            <h3>Document Failures</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Failed experiments get the same treatment as successful ones. We publish what didn't work, why it didn't work, and what we learned. Honesty over optics.</p>

            <h3>Invite Collaboration</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Research isn't a solo act. We invite feedback, contributions, and critiques from anyone willing to engage thoughtfully. The best ideas come from many minds, not just one.</p>

            <h3>Design for Replication</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Every protocol is written to be reproducible by others. We use accessible tools, clear documentation, and open standards so anyone can verify and build on our work.</p>

            <h3>Serve Life, Not Profit</h3>
          </div>
          <p>The goal isn't commercialization. It's knowledge that serves ecological repair and human flourishing. If someone profits, it should be the commons, not private shareholders.</p>
