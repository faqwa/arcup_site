      <h2 aria-label="Introduction: The question that inspired ArcUp">A Question That Started It All</h2>
      <p class="origin-question">
        What if the next big breakthrough was built in the open?
      </p>
      <p>
        That question stayed with me. It wasn't about a specific device or formula — it was about what kind of future 
        we might create if <em>discovery itself became a shared act</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arc^ began not as a product, but as a moment of reflection on how science could return to care, transparency, 
        and collaboration.

        <p>
          ArcUp began in a small room with a flyback transformer, a driver circuit, and a few glass electrodes.
          I had been reading plasma research papers from around the world — seeing how different teams were exploring 
          plasma-water interactions — and decided to test it for myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal was simple: to see whether plasma could influence seed germination.
        </p>
        <p class="experiments-highlight">
          And it did.
        </p>
        <p>
          That small moment — watching seeds respond — revealed a larger truth: plasma can alter biological processes, 
          and the tools to study it don't have to belong to large institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also raised new questions: If I can do this alone, what would it look like if <em>we did it together</em> — in the open?

      <!-- TEXT BLOCK: Response framing -->
      <div class="pattern-response">
        <p>
          ArcUp was born from a refusal of that pattern. It's not rebellion for its own sake — it's a reorientation.
        </p>
        <p class="pattern-emphasis">
          A way of saying that knowledge should circulate, not accumulate. That progress should heal, not harm.

      <h2 aria-label="Transition from individual experiment to open framework">A Framework, Not a Lab</h2>
      <p>
        ArcUp grew from this reflection into a framework — a set of methods, values, and open tools for regenerative
        plasma research. It integrates my background in ecology, computer science, and systems thinking, but sits
        outside the usual institutions that govern innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's science re-practised — built to serve <em>life</em>, not ownership.
