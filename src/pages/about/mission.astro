      <h2 aria-label="ArcUp mission statement and purpose">The Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        ArcUp exists because <em>the way we make technology matters as much as what we make</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to build regenerative plasma systems — openly, safely, and ethically — guided by the values 
        of the <a href={withBase("/how")}>Repractice Framework</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="purpose-emphasis">
        We're not creating products. We're cultivating processes — transparent, interdisciplinary, and rooted in reciprocity.
      </p>

    <!-- For the Many -->
    <Card as="section" class="many-section">
      <h2 aria-label="ArcUp's ethical alignment and inclusivity">For the Many, Not the Few</h2>
      <p>
        ArcUp is for those who refuse extraction and choose regeneration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology should serve <em>the many, not the few</em> — building <em>futures worth inheriting</em> for our 
        communities, our ecosystems, and our shared humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to make plasma research accessible across disciplines — bridging engineers, biologists, artists, 
        and institutions — so that ecological restoration becomes a shared, global experiment.

              Hands-on exploration using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) setups — simple, accessible, off-the-shelf components.

            <p>
              We test plasma-water interactions for purification, agriculture, and ecological applications, sharing results

              The goal is to form a commons of plasma tools where data, blueprints, and safety notes circulate openly yet 
              responsibly, ensuring variants remain traceable and free from enclosure.

              At this stage, governance matters: defensive openness replaces property. ArcUp invites collective custodianship, 
              ensuring that no discovery becomes privately locked down and that all benefit flows back to the commons.

        ArcUp's mission is to create a living backbone for open plasma research — one that connects independent experimenters, 
        academic labs, and communities across borders.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're building a space where knowledge moves freely between art, science, and culture — where technology can once
