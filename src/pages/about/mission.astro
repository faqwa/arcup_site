      <p>
        ArcUp exists because <em>the way we make technology matters as much as what we make</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to build regenerative plasma systems ‚Äî openly, safely, and ethically ‚Äî guided by the values 
        of the <a href={withBase("/how")}>Repractice Framework</a>.

      <p>
        ArcUp is for those who refuse extraction and choose regeneration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology should serve <em>the many, not the few</em> ‚Äî building <em>futures worth inheriting</em> for our 
        communities, our ecosystems, and our shared humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to make plasma research accessible across disciplines ‚Äî bridging engineers, biologists, artists,
        and institutions ‚Äî so that ecological restoration becomes a shared, global experiment.
